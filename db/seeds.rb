  city: "Amsterdam", country: "Holland", category: "adventure", description: "What makes Amsterdam so attractive is the 17th century historical atmosphere combined with the mentality of a modern metropolis creating a friendly and relaxed environment. The small scale of the buildings and the intimacy of the streets, canals and squares create an atmosphere that visitors find unique. The city has the highest museum density in the world and is home to cultural highlights, such as the Van Gogh Museum, Anne Frank House, Hermitage Amsterdam and the Rijksmuseum with Rembrandtâ€™s world-famous Nightwatch. Other well known places of interest in Amsterdam are the Palace on the Dam, the Artis Zoo, Jewish Historical Museum and the Rembrandt House.")

quito = tejas.destinations.create(
  city: "Quito", country: "Ecuador", category: "volunteer", description: "The beautiful city of Quito, Ecuador is nestled in a valley at the base of the Pichincha Volcano. Its exquisite natural surroundings are virtually unparalleled and they provide the perfect background to this picturesque city. Quito is more than just the capital of Ecuador; it is a place of adventure. You will find quite a few ecotours in Quito. Many years ago, Quito was the northern capital of the Incan Empire. The Incas destroyed the city in an effort to prevent it from falling into the hands of the conquistadors. When the country came under Spanish rule only a year later, the city was rebuilt from the ruins that scattered the area. It has stood proudly ever since and the impressive array of colonial architecture in Quito's Old Town is quite breathtaking. As Quito has the best preserved historic center in Latin America it is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. And while there are some wonderful museums and many elegant buildings to see, Quito is not just about ancient history.")
